## Where we grow Bambu

I quickly developed this solution in a single day to meet my need for a reliable, offline tool. It's designed to work seamlessly without the hassle of:

- Monthly subscriptions
- Constant internet reliance
- Waiting on Discord for tech support responses

# Features:
- Upload sliced 3MF files (any number of plates)
- Split 3MF into GCODE files with images
- Keep revisions of identically named 3MF files
- Production Queue that has priorities
- Quickly identify if a sliced file is out of rev before printing
- Assign printer to a production queue print
- Delete files
- Delete queues
- Send to Printer

# Needs:
- Block print with mismatched hardware
- Last Updated on production queue
- Queue a QTY of a print (i.e., qty 6 is 6 actual prints of that plate)
- Printer / Print Tags
- Close out Production Queue when run is marked as completed
- Lock printer when run starts
- Map AMS (and store the mapping for reprints)
- Make UI fancy


This is not a testament to my skills of programming, it is a hack job built on the backs of giants.
